Code for Bachelor's thesis: Solving the Rubik's cube in Gym and on a Lego robot

Code within the Pybricks_code folder must be uploaded to https://code.pybricks.com/ in order to upload to the robot.

Code within the PC_code folder is the code required to control the robot.
The file to run is lego_connect.py.
Within this folder, a subfolder 'twophase' is included. On the first run, Kociemba's two-phase algorithm creates tables. This takes approximately half an hour, so I simply included the file.
